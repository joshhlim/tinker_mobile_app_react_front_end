# :camera: Tinker :camera:

A mobile app built with React Native and run on Expo. If a user has wondered what to wear to a wedding, job interview, or to tinker with his/her fashion; he or she can use device camera roll or camera, send a photo to multiple friends or advisors, receive friendly advice on each photo, and give friendly advice on requests sent to them.

The photos are then sent to [Tinker Backend](https://github.com/limhjosh/tinker_mobile_app_rails_server) where they are uploaded to AWS S3, and that link, along with user information, is stored into a PostgreSQL database.
